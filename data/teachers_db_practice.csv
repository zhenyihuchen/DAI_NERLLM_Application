Before joining IE,  worked at Aalto University and Hanken School of Economics in Finland. She is a licensed psychologist by training and holds a PhD in work psychology.</p><p>Professor Tenhiala has two streams of research. In her first stream, focusing on employee compensation, she is particularly interested in developing our understanding around controversies with respect to pay structure (e.g., pay dispersion, pay disparities), organizational structure (e.g., hierarchies, task interdependence, autonomy), and employee attitudes (e.g., fairness, engagement). She studies peer-based compensation in self-managed organizations, whether pro-equality laws reduce gender pay gap, the impact of pay transparency on motivational climate, among others. Her work in this area has been published in many books and journals such as <em>Strategic Management Journal</em>, <em>Human Resource Management, Human Relations, Organization Studies, Journal of Occupational and Organizational and Psychology</em>. One of her papers, “Perceptions of politics and fairness in merit pay“ received the Emerald Literati Network Award for Excellence.</p><p>Prof Tenhiala has another, emerging stream of research. She has become increasingly interested in the wellbeing of entrepreneurs, and high-growth entrepreneurs in particular. Using unique records-based database, she studies questions related to the wellbeing of the entrepreneurs and possible dilemmas related to managing their companies and their personal lives.</p><p>In the classroom,  aims at creating a psychologically safe environment where students can discover, experiment, collaboratively contribute, and critically reflect. She is a believer in experiental learning methods, such as using cases as a tool for role-play, self-reflection surveys, and simulation.

The overarching theme in his findings is that universally superior practices do not exist, and practices that are effective in some environments often cause havoc in others. His studies, which have received awards from the Academy of Management, Decision Sciences Institute, and the European Foundation for Management Development, have disclosed factors that critically influence the effectiveness of different planning, coordination, and communication practices.</p><p>Prior to joining the academia,  worked first as a process developer in electronics manufacturing and in the telecommunications infrastructure industry.

Consequently, the managers either succeed or fail to choose effective management practices. I have witnessed too many ‘best practice’ implementations that have gone awry because of their contextual unfitness. In my view, business education should create awareness of the pitfalls in the one-size-fits-all solutions.

140,Strategy,29478,,"<p>Coming to IE with a PhD in political science, Associate Professor  tries to bring an understanding of politics behind market actions. His research revolves around one of the central aspects of political economy: when do politicians favor some industries over others, and what are the effects of such favoritism? “Politicians are always favoring some industries over others”, he says, “the question is why? Around the world political &amp; societal context changes how much politicians care about different industries. A firm may be taxed for political benefit in one context, while in another context it will be subsidized”.</p><p>His research focuses on what structural characteristics, such as voting systems, incentivize politicians to support geographically concentrated or dispersed industries. Further, he believes this research can help us understand why cities die. “Cities are just a collection of important firms that drive economic activity in the area. When those firms struggle, so does the city. Understanding when and why politicians react differently to these struggles can give us insight into how quickly or slowly cities can recover”.</p><p>In his courses, he seeks to develop understanding of underlying political contexts in his students. “Understanding what incentivizes political actors to favor or discriminate against firms has far reaching applications to businesses worldwide. When you can know what drives politicians decisions, you can know how viable your business will be within these contexts”.</p><h4>ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE</h4><p>• Associate Professor in Strategy, IE University, 2022 – Present</p><p>• Assistant Professor in Strategy, IE University, 2014 – 2022</p><h4>ACADEMIC BACKGROUND</h4><p>• PhD Comparative Politics, Duke University (USA), 2014</p><p>• M.A. – Economics, Duke University (USA), 2013</p><p>• B.A. Political Science, Michigan State University (USA), 2008</p><p>• B.A. Economics, Michigan State University (USA)</p><p><strong>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs)</strong></p><p>9- Industry, Innovation and Infraestructure</p><p>11- Sustainable Cities and Communities</p><p>16- Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions</p><p><br/></p>",20608,"A smiling man wearing glasses, a grey suit, and a patterned tie standing outdoors with trees in the background.","['man', 'smiling', 'glasses', 'suit', 'outdoors', 'trees']",2022-12-29T07:03:04.979Z,71344,200,200,S,global,0,Aulus Licinius Ahenobarbus

He decided to devote himself to his doctoral studies. Equipped with his new academic experience, his work focuses on identifying the elements that create value in companies.</p><p>In the case of financial markets, for instance, Professor  believes that the impact of stock prices on companies and industries is an understudied field of management. He has found that stock prices influence the behavior of companies, especially when it comes to investment strategies.</p><p>“And this influence is not necessarily positive,” he says. “Financial markets place a value on companies' strategies, but this is just their point of view and they could be wrong. Now, when a customer makes a purchase you do get real feedback”.</p><p>In addition, Professor  is developing a line of research on the management of large companies with a focus on Corporate Environmental Management. Protecting the environment is a very important goal in today's society. The performance of companies increasingly depends on their ability to protect nature and to sell to environmentally conscious consumers.

With this aim to train lawyers with some added value, she has taught lessons in which corporate, accountancy and tax matters were all mixed in a sole case, in order to make the students solve it from all those perspectives. As a lawyer she is interested in civil law, corporate law, bankruptcy law, economical crimes and litigation, dealing with cases that very often involve some of these areas at the same time. She has been Secretary of ICADE Asociación and, throughout the law office LEXINTER ABOGADOS (where she works), she is also a part of the international lawyers network “International Jurists”. She has published in the law magazine LA LEY, in the International Jurists magazine and in the Asociación Balear de Directivos magazine.</p><h4>Corporate Experience</h4><p>• Lawyer in LEXINTER ABOGADOS, Spain, 1998-Present</p><h4>Academic Experience</h4><p>• Professor of Accounting, IE Law School, Spain, 2002-Present</p><h4>Academic Background</h4><p>• Graduate in Law, Pontificia de Comillas University (ICADE), Spain, 1997.</p><p>• Diploma in Business, Pontificia de Comillas University (ICADE), Spain, 1997.</p><p>• Masters in Company Legal Consultancy (MAJ), IE Law School, Spain, 1998.</p>",16198,A woman in professional attire looks intensely off-camera during a discussion or meeting.,"['woman', 'professional', 'meeting', 'intense', 'discussion']",2022-11-18T07:23:57.364Z,8455,170,170,S,global,1,Calpurnia Pulchra

During her PhD, she performed two internship in world-wide reference laboratories, staying 5 months in 2010 in the Laboratory for marine Microbiology in Bremen (Germany), and 6 months in 2011 in the Laboratory of Microbiology of the Netherlands. She mastered (culture-independent) molecular biology techniques based on 16S rRNA gene microbial communities profiling and culture-dependent techniques. As a result of her PhD, she proposed and validated a geomicrobiological model of the functioning of S, Fe, C and N cycles on the anaerobic sediments of Tinto river, an extreme acidic environment. She pioneeringly showed the complexity of the system in contradiction with the relative simplicity observed in the water column. She also demonstrated successfully the application of native Tinto river microbiota to remediate mine drainage water coupled to wastewater. Then, she received a NASA Planetary Biology Internship award to work on microbial electrosynthesis in the laboratory of Prof. Kenneth Nealson in the University of South California, in Los Angeles.</p><p>In her three consecutive a Post-Doctoral positions (2012-2017) at the Laboratory of Microbiology of the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) she expanded her knowledge on the enrichment, isolation and characterization of microbes (with focus on specialized anaerobic techniques), and in physiology and biochemistry. She became an independent Principal Investigator (PI) leading the sulfur cycle group, which focuses on the study of microorganisms related with the sulfur cycle, with a special interest in acidophiles and their application to biotechnological processes. As so, in 2017, she became Assistant Professor (UD2) and one year afterwards, she was promoted to UD1 based on merits. </p><p>By 2023, she published 63 research articles being the first author of 14, last author of 24 and corresponding author of 27, publishing in top journals as <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, etc. Her research on acidophilic environments linked with mining activities resulted in the discovery of 4 novel genera and 3 novel species which are key microbial players in attenuation processes with application for bioremediation. The famous video channel VICE Motherboard featured her Research in a documentary<sup>1</sup> (see link) with further publication in Tweeter, Instagram and Facebook. She aims to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which acidophiles withstand extreme conditions by applying a wide array of omics techniques (meta)genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, as well as biochemical characterization of enzymes. She has discovered novel pathways in the nitrogen, sulfur and carbon cycles. Worth of special mention is her discovery of the 7<sup>th</sup> pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, the glycine reductive pathway, in the sulfate reducer <em>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. </em>Here, her role went from the idea generation, funding acquisition and laboratory experimentation. This text-book changing discovery received a lot of attention for what she got the Research award 2021 from Wageningen Fund Academy for the best paper of the year and was interviewed for journals AS Resource and Wageningen World.</p><p>She has secured funding being awarded with 5 research proposals as PI counting with an impressive international collaborative network of reknown scientists and in collaboration with companies. She has mentor in her group 3 technicians, 2 post-docs and  8 PhD students. Three of her PhD students already defended their doctoral thesis and they currently secured postdoctoral positions or fixed Jobs in reseach institutes or companies. </p><p>Dr. Sanchez-Andrea has being involved for 15 years in educational activities as coordinator and/or lecturer in Master and Bachelor’s courses.

Those were years during which the corporate world finally realized the necessity to shift from a transaction based to a relationship based marketing.</p><p>What really interests Prof  from a marketing standpoint is the management of customer relationships in order to increase a firm’s long-term profitability. “Customers are important intangible assets of a firm that should be valued and managed”, he says. “Only by attracting, retaining, and growing profitable customer relationships firms will be successful in the future”. His research therefore aims to provide managerial implications on how to build profitable and long-lasting customer relationships. His primary concern is to quantify the impact of various customer management activities on a customer’s lifetime value – the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over a customer’s lifetime.</p><p>At the same time, Prof  develops analytical models to estimate or approximate a customer’s lifetime value. “One of the major challenges in customer relationship management is still to arrive at reliable estimates of a customer’s future profits and lifetime”, he says. “Not being able to measure a customer’s lifetime value prevents the development of successful strategies for customer management”.</p><p>Prof  believes that his work on customer relationship management has broad implications for the corporate world. “I intend to develop insights on how to satisfy customer needs, but at the same time to consider the monetary consequences of doing so,” he says. “This will provide firms with a roadmap for growth”.</p><h4>Academic Background</h4><p>• PhD in Marketing, Frankfurt University, Germany</p><p>• SSP, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA</p><p>• MBA, Australian Graduate School of Entrepreneurship, Australia</p><p>• BA in International Business, Reutlingen University, Germany</p><h4>Academic Experience</h4><p>• 2021: Adjunct Professor of Marketing</p><p>• 2017 - 2021: Dean of IE Business School</p><p>• 2012 - 2017: Dean of Programs, IE Business School</p><p>• 2010 - Present: Associate Dean of Master in Management Programs, IE Business School</p><p>• 2008 - 2010: Dean of Undergraduate Studies, IE University</p><p>• 2006 - Present: Professor of Marketing, IE Business School</p><p>• 2006: Visiting Scholar, AGSM, University of New South Wales, Australia</p><p>• 2003 - 2006: Research Associate, E-Finance Lab, Frankfurt, Germany</p><h4>Corporate Experience</h4><p>• Consultancy work with Bain &amp; Company and Accenture</p><h4>LATEST PUBLICATIONS</h4><p>• Gensler, S., Verhoef, P., <strong>Böhm, M.</strong> (2011).

Afterwards, he worked at KWR water research (Nieuwegein, the Netherlands) where he investigated current and novel drinking water treatment and management processes with a specific focus on microbiology and nature-based solutions, that possibly lead to new applications for climate-resilient water treatment and management. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of his research, he collaborated with technologists, hydrologists, analytical chemists and data scientists. </p><p> has been working closely with the Dutch drinking water companies at KWR, their central research institute. He also worked with waterboards, municipalities and wastewater treatment companies throughout his career.

Companies she has worked with include Roche, Aena, Pfizer, Iberdrola, Airbus, the Board for Nuclear Security or Madrid’s Regional Authorities.</p><p>She is now immersed in research into management styles, based on a sample of 436 executives. “We will use the results to determine the skills they need to develop more, and what they do best”, says professor .
